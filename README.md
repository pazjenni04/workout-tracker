## **Description**

The objective of this application is to allow a user to track their workouts.

## **Usage**

Once the user has logged onto the webpage, they will be presented with the homepage.

On the homepage, the user can either choose to create a new workout or to continue entering a previous workout. If the user chooses to enter a new workout, they will proceed with clicking the button "New Workout" and will be redirected to the following page.

On this page, the user can proceed with following the inputs in order to enter a new workout. The pages will prompt questions for the user to complete in order to record the workout. The first question prompted is a drop down menu that will display for the user to choose either a resistance workout or cardio workout - both options, once chosen, will present a different set of questions in order to complete the entry.

Once either of those are completed by the user, the workout will be systematically recorded and a banner to the right hand top corner will display "Workout Added Successfully!"

If the user decides to choose 'Continue Workout' they will then be redirect to the following page -

Once on this page, the user will be prompted with questions again to complete in order to update their tracked exercises. Once the user has completed either options, they can click the "Complete" button and it will redirect them to the homepage and will display their most up-to-date stats.
